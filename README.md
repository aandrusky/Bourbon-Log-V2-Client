Welcome to Bourbon.log v1!

Q: What's it for?

A: Bourbon enthusiasts love talking about bourbon. They take notes on just about every aspect. Doing so helps us become more critical tasters, and socializers within the community. Unfortunately, these notes take place in many forms, and often get lost across all the disparate mediums. Bourbon.log aims to replace all the note books, napkins, mobile notes, and excel sheets and consolidate all that data in a simple and accessible format. 

Q: How does it work?

A: Once logged in, a user will be given options to ‘add new’ and ‘view list’. ‘Add new’ prompts a new form to be completed when the user is about to try a new bourbon. ‘View list’ displays a list of all bourbons the active user has tried and saved. These entries are able to be modified via edit/delete. 

    ***To Run***
        -Start with npm start in project's 'src' directory
        -From API directory run 'json-server -p 8088 -w database.json'
        

Q: But why?

A: I love all the social aspects of bourbon. Collecting it, tasting it, talking about it, I love the culture. Like many others, I have notes about bourbons I’ve tried all over the place: notebooks at home, and notes in note applications on my phone. I want to consolidate all my notes in a single, one-stop-shop place. I don’t always have access to my notebooks, but almost always do my phone, or for now, a computer with my application. (Unrelated) years from now, I’d love to convert this into a mobile application. For now, this browser version offers a proof-of-concept.
